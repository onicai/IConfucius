# Who is IConfucius?

IConfucius is running in canister `dpljb-diaaa-aaaaa-qafsq-cai` and his wisdom is currently available via the Candid UI interface.

https://a4gq6-oaaaa-aaaab-qaa4q-cai.raw.ic0.app/?id=dpljb-diaaa-aaaaa-qafsq-cai

He will become much more accessible from the [IConfucius OpenChat community](https://oc.app/community/e5qnd-hqaaa-aaaac-any5a-cai/channel/2411296919/?ref=45j3b-nyaaa-aaaac-aokma-cai) as explained in the roadmap sections below.

# Why IConfucius?

IConfucius is a standalone **mAIner Agent**, which provides AI work for two top tier ICP dApps, [OpenChat](https://oc.app/community/e5qnd-hqaaa-aaaac-any5a-cai/channel/2411296919/?ref=45j3b-nyaaa-aaaac-aokma-cai) and [odin.fun](https://odin.fun?r=mgb3mzvghe).

**mAIner Agents** are one of the core components of onicai‚Äôs [Proof-of-AI-Work protocol](https://www.onicai.com/#/poaiw) and IConfucius thus demonstrates how PoAIW components may be implemented.

IConfucius operates entirely on-chain on the Internet Computer, including the LLM itself. This approach offers numerous advantages, among them:

1. You maintain full control over your AI and LLM, ensuring security against misuse and hacking.
2. With the Internet Computer's reverse gas model, you control your costs‚Äîno unexpected bills ‚ù£Ô∏è
3. Seamless & secure integration with other ICP applications.

# How IConfucius works

IConfucius is a deployed [llama_cpp_canister](https://github.com/onicai/llama_cpp_canister), loaded with the Qwen 2.5 model, and controlled by a Motoko canister designed to turn the Qwen2.5 LLM into Confucius, the ancient Chinese philosopher. When prompted, it will generate profound quotes about topics.

There are two canisters:

- a Motoko bot canister, in `src/IConfucius`
- a C++ LLM canister, in `llms/IConfucius`.
  - The LLM is loaded with the [qwen2.5-0.5b-instruct-q8_0.gguf](https://huggingface.co/Qwen/Qwen2.5-0.5B-Instruct-GGUF) model

Our OpenChat bot implementation is based on the Motoko [openchat-bot-sdk](https://j4mwm-bqaaa-aaaam-qajbq-cai.ic0.app/openchat-bot-sdk) developed by the ICP community member [Geckteck](https://x.com/Gekctek). Many thanks go out to him.

# Deploy your own IConfucius

This section is for ICP developers who want to learn in detail how IConfucius works.

The instructions in this section cover how you can deploy everything locally on your computer.

One of the great things about the Internet Computer is you can spin up your own local Internet Computer replica, and deploy & test your code.

We hope many of you will deploy your own IConfucius canisters, play with it, learn from it, and
then build & deploy your own on-chain AI agents that do something else. We can't wait to see what you will create.

## Miniconda

Create a conda environment with python dependencies installed.

```bash
# install Miniconda on your system

# create a conda environment
conda create --name IConfucius python=3.11
conda activate IConfucius

# from IConfucius root folder
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Download the Qwen2.5 LLM model

Download qwen2.5-0.5b-instruct-q8_0.gguf from https://huggingface.co/Qwen/Qwen2.5-0.5B-Instruct-GGUF

Place it in this location: `llms/llama_cpp_canister/models/Qwen/Qwen2.5-0.5B-Instruct-GGUF/qwen2.5-0.5b-instruct-q8_0.gguf`

Verify it is in correct location:

```bash
# From root folder:
ls llms/llama_cpp_canister/models/Qwen/Qwen2.5-0.5B-Instruct-GGUF/qwen2.5-0.5b-instruct-q8_0.gguf
```

## mops

Install mops (https://mops.one/docs/install), and then:

```bash
# from folder: `IConfucius/src/IConfucius`
mops install
```

## Install dfx

Since IConfucius is an OpenChat bot, make sure to use the version of dfx prescribed by [open-chat](https://github.com/open-chat-labs/open-chat)

## Deploy open-chat

When running locally, first deploy [open-chat](https://github.com/open-chat-labs/open-chat):

```bash
# from folder: open-chat (repo)
rm -rf .dfx
dfx start --clean
./scripts/deploy-local.sh

# Silence OpenChat's SNS debug logs
dfx --identity anonymous canister stop sgymv-uiaaa-aaaaa-aaaia-cai
```

## Set the OpenChat public key

üöß üöß üöß üöß üöß (Work in progress...)

_SKIP THIS STEP UNTIL FURTHER NOTICE._

Get the public key of your locally running Open Chat instance, by going to:

`Profile settings` > `Advanced` > `Bot client config`

Copy the OpenChat public key and update the variable `openChatPublicKey`.

```JS
// file: src/IConfucius/src/Main.mo

// Update this based on your open chat instance public key
let openChatPublicKey = Text.encodeUtf8("MF...==");
```

## Deploy ALL canisters:

```bash
# from root folder:

# The first time, use this command:
scripts/deploy-IConfucius.sh --mode install --network [local/ic]

# After this, to upgrade the canisters for a code change:
scripts/deploy-IConfucius.sh --mode upgrade --network [local/ic]
```

Notes:

- `--mode install` & `--mode reinstall` take several minutes, because the LLM model is uploaded.
- `--mode upgrade` is fast, because the LLM model is NOT uploaded. All the canisters are
  re-build and re-deployed, but the LLM model is still as a virtual file in the canister's
  stable memory.
- When you deploy to the ic mainnet, it is recommended to do the initial deploy of each
  component manually and specify the subnet. Pick one that is not so busy, because LLMs use a lot of computations.

- When working on Windows, use WSL Ubuntu. To successfully load the LLM model into the LLM canister, you might first have to run
  ```bash
  sudo sysctl -w vm.max_map_count=2097152
  ```

## IConfucius as a command type bot

**Test it works, using dfx**

```bash
# from folder: src/IConfucius

dfx canister call iconfucius_ctrlb_canister IConfuciusSays '(variant {English}, "crypto")' [--ic]
dfx canister call iconfucius_ctrlb_canister IConfuciusSays '(variant {Chinese}, "Âä†ÂØÜË¥ßÂ∏Å")' [--ic]

# From anywhere you can also call the production canister on the IC with:
dfx canister call dpljb-diaaa-aaaaa-qafsq-cai IConfuciusSays '(variant {English}, "crypto")' --ic
dfx canister call dpljb-diaaa-aaaaa-qafsq-cai IConfuciusSays '(variant {Chinese}, "Âä†ÂØÜË¥ßÂ∏Å")' --ic
```

**Registering the bot with OpenChat**

üöß üöß üöß üöß üöß (Work in progress...)

_SKIP THIS STEP UNTIL FURTHER NOTICE._

Follow the instructions in [Registering the bot](https://github.com/open-chat-labs/open-chat-bots?tab=readme-ov-file#installing-the-bot)

- Create two users
- Login as the first user, and search for the second user
- In the Direct Chats chat box, type in `/register_bot` and fill out these fields:
  - Principal = canister_id of IConfucius
    - local: see src/IConfucius/.env
    - ic: see src/IConfucius/canister_ids.json
  - Bot name = IConfucius
  - Bot endpoint
    - local: http://<canister_id>.raw.localhost:8080
      - Note: Check port with `dfx info webserver-port`
    - ic: https://<canister_id>.raw.icp0.io/

## IConfucius as an autonomous type bot

üöß üöß üöß üöß üöß (Work in progress...)

_SKIP THIS STEP UNTIL FURTHER NOTICE._

IConfucius can run in autonomous mode, using timers, and it will thus be possible to connect it to the OpenChat bot platform as an autonomous bot that automatically posts profound quotes on a regular basis.

However the Motoko openchat-bot-sdk does not yet support API keys, only Command type bots.

As soon as the SDK supports API keys, we will implement this capability.

**Start the timers**

```bash
# from root folder:
scripts/start-timers.sh --network [local/ic]
scripts/stop-timers.sh --network [local/ic]
```

After some time, several quotes have been generated.

IConfucius saves all his generated quotes in a stable memory data structure, and as the controller of the canister, you can pull them out:

```bash
# from folder: src/IConfucius
dfx canister call iconfucius_ctrlb_canister getQuotesAdmin --output json [--ic]
dfx canister call iconfucius_ctrlb_canister getNumQuotesAdmin --output json [--ic]
```

# Prompt Design

We designed the prompt using [scripts/prompt-design.ipynb](https://github.com/onicai/IConfucius/blob/main/scripts/prompt-design.ipynb).

The python notebook runs llama.cpp directly on your computer, and you can very quickly try out modifications.

Make sure to design your own prompts so that the repetitive part is at the beginning, to benefit from prompt caching. When running LLMs inside a canister, this will help tremendously with cost & latency.

# Tips & Tricks

## Adding cycles

The LLM canister burns a lot of cycles, and you will quickly run out.

When working locally, you easily add cycles to all the deployed canisters with:

```bash
# From the canister folders: to add 2 trillion cycles
dfx ledger fabricate-cycles --all --t 2
```
